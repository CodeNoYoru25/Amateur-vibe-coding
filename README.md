# Amateur-vibe-coding
Tried hands on vibe coding for the first time. Created a simple game.
# My First Browser Game ðŸŽ®

Built with [Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/) and AI-assisted coding via Cursor.

## What It Does
A block collects coins and scores pointsâ€”simple, fun, and my first step into vibe coding.

## Why I Built It
I was curious, hesitant, and a bit shy about tech. But once I started, I couldnâ€™t stop. This game is proof that curiosity > hesitation.

## Tools I Used
- Kaboom.js
- Cursor
- VS Code extensions
- YouTube & books (see LinkedIn post for full list!)
